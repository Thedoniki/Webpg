in static folder you can add
images, css, js files and other static files that you want to use in your website.
For example, you can create a folder named "images" and add your images there, then
you can use them in your HTML files like this:
<img src="/static/images/your-image.jpg" alt="Your Image">
You can also create a folder named "css" and add your CSS files there, then you can link them in your HTML files like this:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/your-style.css">
Similarly, you can create a folder named "js" and add your JavaScript files there,
then you can link them in your HTML files like this:
<script src="/static/js/your-script.js"></script>
Make sure to organize your static files in a way that makes it easy to manage and maintain your website.
You can create subfolders within the static folder to further categorize
your files if needed. For example, you can have a folder named "fonts" for your font files, or a folder named
"videos" for your video files. Just remember to update the paths in your HTML files accordingly when you add new static files.

to load them to a html file with jinja you write something like this:
<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/your-script.js') }}"></script>
This will ensure that the correct path to your static files is generated, regardless of where your HTML
files are located in your project structure.


whenever i have {{}} <- means that we are going to write a python expression that will be evaluated and the result will be inserted into the HTML.
In this case, we are using the url_for function to generate the correct URL for our static files. The url_for function takes two arguments:
the first is the name of the endpoint (in this case, 'static'), and the second is a keyword argument that specifies the filename of the static
file we want to load. By using url_for,
we can ensure that our static files are correctly linked in our HTML, regardless of where our HTML files are located in our project structure.
